The Mountain Tourist Badge of the Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society (GOT PTTK) is an award established to promote mountain tourism. Obtaining this badge is therefore associated with practicing mountain tourism.

The most popular types of the GOT PTTK are:

- **Popular** – with one level,
- **Small** – with three levels: bronze, silver, and gold.

Tourists earn points for the trips they take, which they can use to apply for the badge. To obtain the popular badge, one must earn 60 points. For the small badge, 120 points are required for the bronze level, 360 points for the silver level, and 720 points for the gold level. If the route of the trip is listed in the official, point-counting routes for the GOT PTTK, the scoring provided in that list should be used. Otherwise, one point is awarded for each kilometer traveled and one point is awarded for every 100 meters of elevation gained during ascents.

The document authorizing the acquisition and wearing of the GOT PTTK badges is the GOT PTTK booklet. The booklet must be filled out by the individual and then submitted for verification. An important element of the booklet is the inclusion of proof of completing the listed route in the form of photos of PTTK shelters and characteristic landscape features or post stamps with the names of towns. It is also possible to attach proof of completing the route in the form of a screenshot from any location-tracking application. Proof of completing the route is not required if a PTTK mountain tourism guide participated in the trip and confirms this fact with their signature, guide's number and, if possible, a personalized stamp.

Routes entered in the GOT PTTK booklet must be confirmed by a PTTK mountain tourism guide. The guide has authorization for a specific mountain group and determines whether the tourist actually completed the listed route based on the attached proof or the date of the trip. All routes entered in the GOT PTTK booklet must be confirmed by a guide.

The booklets of individuals applying for the popular and small GOT PTTK are verified by the Field Verification Departments of the GOT PTTK or the Central Verification Department of the GOT PTTK.

The aim of the project is to offer an alternative to the paper GOT PTTK booklet in the form of an electronic system. The system will provide the ability to enter, modify, and delete data concerning the segments of routes counted for the GOT PTTK by authorized users, as well as to search for and present route segments to all users. Additionally, the system will allow for documenting trips taken as part of obtaining various types and levels of the GOT PTTK.

As part of the project, an application using a database was designed. The designed application was implemented as a native mobile application for the Android system with a local SQLite database.

The main branch contains the project documentation. The implementation of the mobile application, along with tests, can be found in the mobile_app branch.
